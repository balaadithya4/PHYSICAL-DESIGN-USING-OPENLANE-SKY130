In this repository i'm going to update my progress about making a CHIP

Author : Bala Adithya

Why am i doing this?
So I am learning about how to make a CHIP as you know.
As part of that I'm learning Physical Design using an open source software called OPENLANE -SKY130
It's basically a colab between google and Sky water to make open source EDA tools

DAY2

Determining the width and height of the cell

Okay so what's a NETLIST

Netlist describes the "connectivity" of an electronics design

We till now just defined in terms of logic blocks, but it's not how they are going to be on a chip .
So we are now assigning dimensions to the blocks.

Now let's assign area to the individual block's
say 1 unit by 1 unit
